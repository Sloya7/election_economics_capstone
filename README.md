This project is designed to run a machine learning Random Forest Classifier on mineral, market and presidential data. 

Once the project is loaded, run the one of the following code to run all previous codes: 
Model_inspections.feature_inspections.py
Create_ML.test_ML.py

If you want to print the graphs using python files, the confusion_matrix and data_distro files will do so. You also may use the 
project_visuals Jupyter Notebook to see the visual in one place.
