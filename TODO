#complete file structure review after revamp
the file structure of this project needs some work. Since restructuring, every files needs to be run individually to ensure each still runs correctly. 

#figure out the plotting situation for data compiled.


#Complete ML data splits
After that is complete, the ML can continue to be worked on. The code currently splits data into train and test prior to dividing out the y, x segments. 

Examples show that all 4 can be done at once and this needs to be looks into since dividing after the fact might not pair the y and x values for testing indices correctly(maybe)

#ML development
consider if a ML is actually needed for this and what variable is accessable prior to elections. Maybe do prior 2 years or something more obtainable to make predictions.
