ETF loop development
When given a few hardcoded file paths to loop through, the loops formatted the data as expected. However, once looping through the 1000+ files,
some file specific error began appears. These errors are mainly file formatting issues such as unreadable characters,
incorrect columns, and incorrect dates. To start, all files that had formatting issues were not included in the data provided to the 
machine learning models. This totaled 24 files and is likely a reasonable removal. If more questions or more time is alloted to the project, it
is possible to check the individual files and make adjustments if possible to include the information however, it is currently beyond the scope
and time allotment for this project.
