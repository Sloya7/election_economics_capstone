ETF loop development
When given a few hardcoded file paths to loop through, the loops formatted the data as expected. However, once looping through the 1000+ files,
some file specific error began appears. These errors are mainly file formatting issues such as unreadable characters,
incorrect columns, and incorrect dates. To start, all files that had formatting issues were not included in the data provided to the 
machine learning models. 
to make the loop work, a block of code to loop through a directory was added. 
once the files were placed in the dir for processing, some specific errors occured with files. 
a try, exception block was added to help troubleshooting and to try and incorportate as many files as possible.
