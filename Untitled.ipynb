    "There are thousands of files that all span different lengths of time and values. The ultimate goal is to know if the market is moving in a staistically significant positive or negative direction. In order to make that determination, each individual relavant entity must be known as moving in a significant direction. As a stock like Apple might move hundreds of dollars in a month and not be considered significant but a start up companyu might move the same amount and might be quite significant for it. To try and minimize the impact of individual stocks or companies having a significant price movement, only the ETF files will be processed as they group similar categories of companies together and reduce seen market volitility."
