####  PREPROCESSING ###


ETF loop development
When given a few hardcoded file paths to loop through, the loops formatted the data as expected. However, once looping through the 1000+ files,
some file specific error began appears. These errors are mainly file formatting issues such as unreadable characters,
incorrect columns, and incorrect dates. To start, all files that had formatting issues were not included in the data provided to the 
machine learning models. This totaled 24 files and is likely a reasonable removal. If more questions or more time is alloted to the project, it
is possible to check the individual files and make adjustments if possible to include the information however, it is currently beyond the scope
and time allotment for this project. 

Mineral price preprocessing
the skeleton of the ETF development was used to complete this preprocessing as well. A few minor tweeks were made since the silver and gold prices
will be seperate databases that are added in individually. I opted to keep the Open, Close and change values for the gold and silver DBs. While they may
not be used in the initial training and analysis, having the values readily available for future developments of this concept seems prudent.


Presidents
This database initally presented a few challenges in combing the original 3 databases however, after reviewing what the scope of the project is, only one database was needed. While the origianl intent was to use the winner database as a dictionary system with the year and name as keys, this became quite complicated since the name were inconsistently formatted. Since string parsing became a hurdle, the alternative of using the one database and using the index position of the winner was adopted.
